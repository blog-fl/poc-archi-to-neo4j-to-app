    "# Proof of Concept: Archi to Neo4j to App\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I often use Archi for my daily work. During my research I came across the following article: https://medium.com/geekculture/using-a-graph-database-to-explore-your-archimate-model-df7bd63f65dd. The aim of this PoC is to reconstruct the described procedure and to solve a use case with it.\n",

    "## Setting the Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Archi Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As a basis, I have created an exemplary reference model with Archi, which containts simplified elements of APQC'S PROCESS CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORKÂ® CROSS-INDUSTRY.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reference: https://www.apqc.org/resource-library/resource-listing/apqc-process-classification-framework-pcf-cross-industry-pdf-12*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have exported this model as a CSV (/archi-csv/ReferenceModel_APQC_PFC)\n",
    "I have also copied the files for ArchIsurance from https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/misc/tree/main/archi to (/archi-csv/ArchIsurance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created an account for https://neo4j.com/sandbox.\n",
